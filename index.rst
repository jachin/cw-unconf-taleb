Applied Epistemology
====================

- randomness
- probability
- uncertainty
- risk

Fooled By Randomness
====================

- Humans are not good a probabilities.
- Humans really like causal relationships.

Birthday Problem
================

How many people do you need in the same room before there's a 50% change that at two people will have the same birthday?

Monte Carlo Machine
===================

- Flipping a coin 100 times.
   - Wow! 7 heads in a row. That amazing.
   - Actually, there's a 52% chance that will happen.
- 10,000 traders
   - Each has a 45% chance to make $10,000 per year.
   - Each has a 55% change to lose $10,000 per year.
   - After 5 years
     - 184 have made $50,000.

Solon’s Warning
===============

    "...it does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear."

The Black Swan
==============

       "Mistaking a naïve observation of the past as something definitive or representative of the future is the one and only cause of our inability to understand the Black Swan."

       -- Nassim Taleb

.. slide::

       "In general, positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly—it is much easier and much faster to destroy than to build."

      -- Nassim Taleb

The Black Swan Formula 
======================

::

  Heath Ledger dies
    + Michelle Williams
    + Google Image Search
    + Minnpost
   = Insane Amounts of Traffic

   "Literally, Heath Ledger brought our cluster down."

    * The internet is a hotbed of black swan events.
    * As our world becomes more interconnected Black Swans will only become more important.
    * "What do you think will be the next black swan?"

Antifragile
===========

What is the opposite of "fragile"?

Fragile:
  Hurt by small amounts of stress.
Robust:
  Not hurt by small amounts of stress.
Antifragile:
  Small amounts of stress makes them stronger (often times lack of strees makes them weaker).

Clockwork's Software
====================

 - All software is very fagile.
 - All the hardware we use is fragile.

Clockwork's Process
===================

- Clockwork has a very antifragile process.
- Lots of small mistakes
- Lots of small improvements

Clockwork's Team
================

- Trust grows when things go wrong.

       "Mistaking a naïve observation of the past as something definitive or representative of the future is the one and only cause of our inability to understand the Black Swan."

       -- Nassim Taleb

.. slide::

       "In general, positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly—it is much easier and much faster to destroy than to build."

      -- Nassim Taleb

The Black Swan Formula 
======================

  Heath Ledger dies
    + Michelle Williams
    + Google Image Search
    + Minnpost
   = Insane Amounts of Traffic

    * The internet is a hotbed of black swan events.
    * As our world becomes more interconnected Black Swans will only become more important.
    * "What do you think will be the next black swan?"

Antifragile
===========

What is the opposite of "fragile"?

Frafile:
  Hurt my small amounts of stress.
Robust:
  Not hurt by small amounts of stress.
Antifragile:
  Small amounts of stress makes them stronger (often times lack of strees makes them weaker).

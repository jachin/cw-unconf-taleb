The Black Swan
==============

////

## "Mistaking a naïve observation of the past as something definitive or representative of the future is the one and only cause of our inability to understand the Black Swan.

## "In general, positive Black Swans take time to show their effect while negative ones happen very quickly—it is much easier and much faster to destroy than to build."

# Heath Ledger dies + Michelle Williams + Google + Minnpost = Insane Amounts of Traffic

### Literally, Heath Ledger brought our cluster down.
-- Matt Gray in an email sent to staff@ 2008-1-22

////

* The internet is a hotbed of black swan events.
* As our world becomes more interconnected Black Swans will only become more important.
* "What do you think will be the next black swan?"

Antifragile
===========

## What is the opposite of "fragile"?

////

* ## Frafile: Hurt my small amounts of stress.
* ## Robust: Not hurt by small amounts of stress.
* ## Antifragile: Small amounts of stress makes them stronger (often times lack of strees makes them weaker).
